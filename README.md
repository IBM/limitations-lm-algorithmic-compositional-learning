## Limitations of Language Models for Algorithmic Compositional Learning

This repository contains code for the paper "Limits of Transformer Language Models on Learning
to Compose Algorithms", NeurIPS 2024. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05785).

This repository contains generation code for the tasks used in the paper and it contains code to run the prompting experiments.

For generating data, please see `generate_data_example.py` and all config files that start with 'training_...' and for running prompting experiments, see `run_prompting_experiments.py` and all configs with 'prompting' in the name.
